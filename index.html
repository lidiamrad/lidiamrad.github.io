My research focuses on solving problems, analytically and/or computationally, arising from physical setups such as those describing liquid crystals, population growth patterns, or epidemiology. The techniques I use belong to the areas of partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, agent-based modeling, and numerical simulations.

Teaching mathematics has been an integral part of my professional journey, starting as a high school teacher, then throughout my graduate and postdoctoral years, and now as faculty. I enjoy teaching such a rich topic to students from a variety of backgrounds. I am always looking for outreach opportunities beyond the classroom as well as ways to support students from under-represented identities in their pursuit of mathematics.

Before coming to <a href="https://www.mtholyoke.edu/directory/faculty-staff/lidia-mrad" target="_blank">Mount Holyoke College</a>, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Arizona where I was mentored by <a href="http://lega.uazmath.org/" target="_blank">Joceline Lega</a>. I received my Ph.D. in mathematics from Purdue University under the supervision of <a href="https://www.math.purdue.edu/people/bio/phillips" target="_blank">Daniel Phillips</a>.

Research
==============================================================
My work is situated along a spectrum between theoretical and applied mathematics. The motivation for the problems I work on is always rooted in answering questions which interest scientists, specifically experimental physicists or public health specialists. My technical approaches utilize both analytical and computational tools. My focus has recently been more on the computational aspects, but I still aim for analytical results to complement them.

****************************************************************************************************

From a mathematical perspective, the methods I use fall under the areas of *partial differential equations* and the *calculus of variations*. I also build tools for agent-based modeling or utilize existing *computational methods* for my work.

Themes 
--------------------------------------------------------------- 
<font color=teal> **_Liquid Crystals_** </font>

One of my main application areas is that of liquid crystals, which are intermediate phases of matter between liquids and crystalline solids. Molecules of these phases possess an orientational order (molecules tend to align with each other), with some phases having positional order as well (molecules aggregate in planes in addition to aligning). Such characteristics endow liquid crystals with unique physical properties, rendering them useful in a variety of applications as illustrated by their widespread use in optical displays (LCDs). Their applicability, however, is not limited to optical devices and it has been extended over the years to biological and pharmaceutical applications, among others. 

My research targets the optical as well as the biological utilizations of liquid crystals. There are many phases of liquid crystals that range from liquid-like to solid-like, each phase requiring different modeling approaches, and I consider a variety of phases in my work.

<font color=teal> **_Population Dynamics_** </font>

Another line of applications, which I started during my postdoctoral training, concerns spatial population dispersion, specifically of mosquitoes for the purpose of disease control. I address questions linked to the spread of *aedes aegypti*, the yellow fever mosquito that can cause dengue fever and other diseases. My work focuses on simulating the flight of mosquitoes over heterogeneous spatial grids with the goal of producing efficient intervention suggestions. In addition to creating agent-based modeling tools for mosquito populations, I am also interested in the more abstract question of population dynamics and how different species can interact in ways that affect their coexistence.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
    We study order reconstruction (OR) solutions in the Beris-Edwards framework for nematodynamics, for both passive and active nematic flows in a microfluidic channel. OR solutions exhibit polydomains and domain walls, and as such, are of physical interest. We show that OR solutions exist for passive flows with constant velocity and pressure, but only for specific boundary conditions. We prove the existence of unique, symmetric and non-singular nematic profiles, for boundary conditions that do not allow for OR solutions. We compute asymptotic expansions for OR-type solutions for passive flows with non-constant velocity and pressure, and active flows, which shed light on the internal structure of domain walls. The asymptotics are complemented by numerical studies that demonstrate the universality of OR-type structures in static and dynamic scenarios.

Stepien, <font color=darkred> *Chaos*</font>, 33, 063121 (2023) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0138150" target="_blank">[doi]</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04342" target="_blank">[arxiv]</a> <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  The May–Leonard model was introduced to examine the behavior of three competing populations where rich dynamics, such as limit cycles and nonperiodic cyclic solutions, arise. In this work, we perturb the system by adding the capability of global mutations, allowing one species to evolve to the other two in a linear manner. We find that for small mutation rates, the perturbed system not only retains some of the dynamics seen in the classical model, such as the three-species equal-population equilibrium bifurcating to a limit cycle, but also exhibits new behavior. For instance, we capture curves of fold bifurcations where pairs of equilibria emerge and then coalesce. As a result, we uncover parameter regimes with new types of stable fixed points that are distinct from the single- and dual-population equilibria characteristic of the original model. On the contrary, the linearly perturbed system fails to maintain heteroclinic connections that exist in the original system. In short, a linear perturbation proves to be significant enough to substantially influence the dynamics, even with small mutation rates.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  We study the aggregation phenomenon in lyotropic chromonic liquid crystals as the molecular concentration changes and condensing agents are added into the system. Using properties of the critical points of the Oseen-Frank energy of a nematic liquid crystal, combined with the geometric constraints of the hexagonal columnar chromonic phases, we show that the minimizers of the total energy are topologically equivalent to tori, in agreement with available experimental evidence on chromonic liquid crystals and DNA condensates, in viral capsids as well as in free solution. We model the system as bi-phasic, consisting of liquid crystal molecules and water, and postulate the total energy as the sum of the Flory-Huggins energy of mixing together with the bending and surface tension contributions of the liquid crystal. Two types of problems are considered, one related to finding the optimal shape of a torus, once the phase separation has occurred, and the second one that models the conditions leading to molecular aggregation. This work follows recent experimental investigations, but without addressing the topological properties of the toroidal nuclei observed and focusing on how the liquid crystal order competes with the aggregation phenomenon.

  If a surface stabilized ferroelectric liquid crystal cell is cooled from the smectic-A to the smectic-C phase, its layers thin causing V-shaped (chevron like) defects to form. These create an energy barrier that can prevent switching between equilibrium patterns. We examine a gradient flow for a mesoscopic Chen-Lubensky energy $F(\Psi,\mathbf{n})$ that allows the order parameter to vanish, so that the energy barrier does not diverge if the layer thickness becomes small. The liquid crystal can evolve during switching in such a way that the layers are allowed to melt and heal near the chevron tip in the process.

Teaching
==============================================================
My teaching is sustained by my passion for mathematics and my evolving practice teaching it. Over time, I came to believe that a student-centered classroom provides an opportunity for students to fully participate and do mathematics together. In this environment, my role is to promote this participation by instructing with questions rather than answers and giving students appropriate time, space, and resources to engage these questions. My hope is to make learning mathematics both fun and appropriately challenging to promote community and growth. Furthermore, my grading evolved to be based on student reflection on my feedback and opportunities for showing progress with less time restrictions than the traditional system provides.

My pedagogical methods are a fusion of ideas from <a href="https://www.comathinquiry.org/" target="_blank">inquiry approaches</a> to learning and <a href="https://gradingforgrowth.com/ " target="_blank">alternative grading</a>.

In 2016-2017, I received the Teaching and Service Prize for non-tenure faculty from the Mathematics Department at the University of Arizona. In 2012-2013, I received the Excellence in Teaching Award from the Department of Mathematics at Purdue University. The same year, I received the CETA Excellence in Teaching Award from the Committee for the Education of Teaching Assistants at Purdue University.
